A linear regression (slope + intercept) example for demonstrating the multi-threading version C++ (stochastic gradient descent).

* simulator.py: simulating the data points, learning the model, and visualizing the learned models.

* data\_x.txt and data\_y.txt: simulated data.

* Makefile: for "mt\_train.cpp" and "mt\_hello.cpp".

* mt\_hello.cpp (excutable: mt\_hello): Hello-world program for mt (POSIX) C++ (reference is [here](http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-multithreading.html), in Chinese).

* mt\_train.cpp (excutable: mt\_train): a scratch for the mt C++ program (the learning algorithm).

* run\_mt.sh: submit the above excutable in cluster.
